// Activity 5: Understanding const
// Task 6: Try reassigning a variable declared with const and observe the error.
-> 
Reassigning a variable declared with const in JavaScript will result in a TypeError. The const declaration creates a read-only reference to a value, which means that once a variable is assigned, it cannot be reassigned.

In JavaScript, == and === are both comparison operators, but they behave differently in terms of type coercion.

1).== (Equality Operator):

The == operator compares two values for equality, but it performs type coercion if the values are of different types. This means that before comparing, JavaScript will attempt to convert the values to a common type.

2).=== (Strict Equality Operator):

The === operator compares two values for equality without performing type coercion. This means that for the comparison to return true, both the value and the type must be the same.
