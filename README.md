# 30-Days-JavaScript-Challenge

//DAY 1

// Activity 5: Understanding const
// Task 6: Try reassigning a variable declared with const and observe the error.
-> 
Reassigning a variable declared with const in JavaScript will result in a TypeError. The const declaration creates a read-only reference to a value, which means that once a variable is assigned, it cannot be reassigned.
